Your project is configured to compile against Android SDK 34, but the following plugin(s) require to be compiled against a higher Android SDK version:
- app_links compiles against Android SDK 36
- desktop_webview_auth compiles against Android SDK 36
- device_info_plus compiles against Android SDK 36
- file_selector_android compiles against Android SDK 36
- flutter_local_notifications compiles against Android SDK 35
- flutter_native_splash compiles against Android SDK 35
- flutter_plugin_android_lifecycle compiles against Android SDK 36
- google_sign_in_android compiles against Android SDK 36
- image_picker_android compiles against Android SDK 36
- package_info_plus compiles against Android SDK 36
- path_provider_android compiles against Android SDK 36
- shared_preferences_android compiles against Android SDK 36
- sqflite_android compiles against Android SDK 36
- syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer compiles against Android SDK 36
- url_launcher_android compiles against Android SDK 36
Fix this issue by compiling against the highest Android SDK version (they are backward compatible).
Add the following to /home/runner/work/EWUmate/EWUmate/android/app/build.gradle.kts:

    android ***
        compileSdk = 36

Execution failed for task ':app:checkReleaseAarMetadata'.

       1.  Dependency 'androidx.credentials:credentials-play-services-auth:1.5.0' requires libraries and applications that
           depend on it to compile against version 35 or later of the
           Android APIs.

           :app is currently compiled against android-34.

           Recommended action: Update this project to use a newer compileSdk
           of at least 35, for example 36.

           Note that updating a library or application's compileSdk (which
           allows newer APIs to be used) can be done separately from updating
           targetSdk (which opts the app in to new runtime behavior) and
           minSdk (which determines which devices the app can be installed
           on).
